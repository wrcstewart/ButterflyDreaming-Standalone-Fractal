# Refresh the vendored module from the ButterflyDreaming working tree.
#
# Vendoring is deliberate — a developer should be able to open the module, read
# it and break it without a server — but the cost is DRIFT, and this project has
# paid it before: two copies of an earlier module diverged and polish landed in
# only one of them. So the copy is refreshed by one deliberate command, and the
# commit it came from is written down.
#
# COPY-DOWN, NOT A MERGE. Local changes to music_module.html are discarded.

# The sampler's four notes. The module loads them from ./bass-recorder/ relative
# to ITSELF, so they are part of the module, not of the page around it — and
# because they are BINARY they are easy to forget when vendoring a .html file.
#
# Forgetting them does not raise an error. `Tone.loaded()` simply never
# resolves, so samplerReady stays false and Play never leaves its disabled
# state, while every control that needs only the script text lights up
# normally. That looked like a broken library and was a missing directory.
